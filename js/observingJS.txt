8. Compare and contrast each thing you've done here to your
   implementation in C++. Answer the following questions:

   - What new perspective did you gain by redoing the lab in
     JavaScript?

     This lab is an introduction to JS, and I learn how to write basic functions in JS.

   - Can you point to one instance where the lack of types in
     JavaScript was damaging to your productivity?
   
     I was confused about rendorstack function, as I wasn't sure what the term "element" was referring to.

   - Did JavaScript's lack of types surprise you? Or hurt you in any
     way? Or was it easier than C++ because you didn't have to
     annotate the program with types? Either answer is fine here, as
     long as you provide some thoughtful reflection.

	JavaScript's lack of types is similar to Python programming. It makes coding a bit eaiser as I start learning programming with Python. However, compare to C++, I need to be very careful, since any sloppiness in types would not show up in compile time.

   - Describe a few features of programming your previous lab that you
     used here. For example, describe how you observed any of the
     following in JS:
	
	Using stack directly as an object seems to work well here. I don't need to write public and private class in this case. The Maps is a built in dictionary, and very easy to implement. The typing is very different, as JS does not require explicit type during programming.
